# LaTex Template for Law Students (Germany)

This is a template for law papers written with LaTex.

The latex class respects a lot of necessary specifications of german universities.

This project is originally made by [Martin Sievers](https://github.com/sieversMartin/hausarbeit-jura) and edited by myself. I have cleaned up the LaTex class (jura.cls) and fixed some warnings. Unter the hood I didn't changed a lot but I want to improve this class especially for students of the FernUniversit√§t in Hagen.

You can find the CTAN project of the original project here: https://ctan.org/pkg/hausarbeit-jura?lang=de.

## Usage

Download the whole repository and start writing in `paper.tex`. Put the single chapter into `chapters/`.

The easiest way to use this template is with [Atom](https://atom.io) and [Atom Latex](https://atom.io/packages/atom-latex) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the LaTex packages. The file will automatically compiled on save.

Note: Before you can work with LaTex, you need the packages of it. Take a look at [latex project](https://www.latex-project.org) to see what you need for your operating system.
